# Requirements
## _Introduction_

The project Hospital Management System is a database where we can get all the informations about the medical condition and medical rescords of the patient. Here we collect the data of the patient and store it for the fture purpose and i t can be only accessed by the hospital officials for the future referance purpose of the patient.

## Research

The Hospital Management System was created in a simple console application, the system can be accessed only by providing proper login credentials. The user can do a lot of task in the system as listed below,

- Add patients record
- List patients record
- Search patients record
- Edit patients record
- Delete patients record

> We can access the record only by using the proper login credentials
> The system contains function that can manage the patient information being stored in the system.
> The user can update the current patient information.
>  The entered data are stored as a text extension file in the system folder.


## Cost and Features and Timeline

File handling, functions and structures are the main things which make up this project. The key features of Hospital management system are listed below:

- Security is high in this application.
- Insert new patient record: with information such as name, gender, age, address, mobile no., email, problem and prerscribed doctor.
- Edit patient record: edit information such as name, gender, age, address, mobile no., email, problem and prerscribed doctor.
- Delete patient record: deletes record from the file.
- Display patient records: lists all the records stored in the file with their respective medical details.
- Search patient record: based on name.

## Defining our system

The Hospital Management System is a very simple project that can help you understand the basic concepts of functions, file handling, and structures. We have a login system which is used to secure the data from third party users. This program will teach you how to add, list, change or edit, search and remove data from/to a file. Adding new records, listing them, editing and updating them, looking for saved records, and removing records are simple Functions that make up the main menu of this system. Personal information, such as name, age, diseases is requested when you add a record to your file. These records can then be updated, entered, searched, and deleted. I’ve used a lot of functions, And these functions are easy to understand since their name means just their respective operations. Therefore the main purpose of the system is to record and organize your record details within the software.

## SWOT Analysis

It is simple system for the user to store complete information (e.g. name, phone number) about his or her personal details. It’s simple for the user to simply check his appropriate  records by entering the patients name. It reduces the risk of third parrty users. The weakness would involve, the user can save the different phone number to the same person that could leads to confusion. The threat would involve, if the record was deleted from the saved file it would be permanently deleted.
